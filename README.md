<h3> About the Company: </h3>
<p> Cyclistic is a bike-share company located in Chicago (USA) that offers a variety of bike-share programs. Nowadays, the company manages more than 5,824 bicycles that are tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across the state. Cyclistic offers different types of bikes and many pricing plans to attract mixed customer segments. 
<p> The princing plans offered by Cyclistic are: </p>
<li> Single - ride passes. </li>
<li> Full - day passes. </li>
<li> Annual Membership. </li> <br>
<p> Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Until now, the marketing campaign focused on targeting new customers and creating general awareness. With this discovery, the Marketing Director decided to develop a new campaign aimed to convert casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, the marketing analyst team needs more clear understanding on how annual members and casual riders differ. </p>
<h3> Business Task: </h3>
Our goal is to provide the marketing team with insights about how the anual members behaviour differs from the casual riders.
